A web application that addresses the challenges faced by electric vehicle (EV) users in accessing information about EV charging infrastructure providers. The web application aims to connect EV users, enabling them to assume dual roles as service providers and users. It offers interactive maps for tracking travel and destinations, facilitates user matching based on specific requirements, and provides information on payment methods and charging rates for available chargers. The goal is to bridge the information gap, promote communication within the EV community, and empower users to foster the growth of the electric vehicle ecosystem. This comprehensive platform on GitHub facilitates information exchange, enhances user experiences, and encourages the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.
